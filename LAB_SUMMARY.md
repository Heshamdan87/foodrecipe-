# 🍳 Food Recipes Application - Lab Summary

## Project Overview
**IBM Course Final Project** - Complete food recipes web application with both static and dynamic implementations.

## ✅ What We Built

### 1. Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript Website
- **Location**: `static-site/` folder
- **Features**: Client-side recipe management, localStorage persistence
- **Access**: Open `static-site/index.html` in browser

### 2. Node.js Full-Stack Application  
- **Location**: Root directory
- **Features**: Express server, REST API, WebSocket real-time updates
- **Access**: http://localhost:3001 (currently running)

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Both Applications Include:
✅ Recipe browsing with beautiful card layout  
✅ Category filtering (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Dessert, Snack)  
✅ Real-time search functionality  
✅ Add new recipes with form validation  
✅ View detailed recipe information  
✅ Delete recipes with confirmation  
✅ Responsive mobile-friendly design  
✅ Modern UI with animations and transitions  

### Node.js Application Additional Features:
✅ RESTful API with full CRUD operations  
✅ Real-time WebSocket communication  
✅ Connection status monitoring
